This repo contains music data and tools for the quattro sound driver. Everything is provided as-is and with no warranty.

To build, you need msys2. run "make" then drag qck.ini to quattroplay.

For built binary check release directory.

Song data is in src. Check "trademark.s" and "dynalloc/dynalloc.s" for black magic.

The include files contain the song command macros and are somewhat well documented.
